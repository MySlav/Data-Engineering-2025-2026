# Data Engineering (2025/2026)

This repository contains course materials, examples, and lab exercises for the Data Engineering course in the 2025/2026 academic year.

## Repository structure

The repo is organized into subfolders, one per lab or exercise. Each folder includes code, datasets (if provided), and any supporting notes.

Example layout:
- `EX_4/` – Exercise 4 materials (notebooks, scripts, instructions)
- `EX_5/` – Exercise 5 materials
- `...`

> New exercises and labs will be added in separate folders.

## How to use

1. Open the folder for the exercise you’re working on (e.g. `EX_4/`).
2. Follow the instructions in that folder’s notebook / README / code comments.
3. Run the code in your own environment (conda / container / etc.) unless otherwise specified.

## Environment / requirements

We will be using **Podman containers** to run the required technologies and services (databases, tools, etc.).

Some exercises may include:
- a `requirements.txt` (Python dependencies), and/or
- one or more `*.yaml` / `*.yml` container definitions.

The YAML files are intended to be used with Podman so you can reproduce the same environment used in class.

## Notes

- This repo is for educational use in the Data Engineering course.
- Datasets in this repo may be for coursework only and should not be shared publicly outside the class.
